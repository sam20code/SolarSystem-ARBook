# SolarSystem-ARBook
I have created ARBook to make it understand what is ARBook and how does it function I have taken a topic of Solar System which shows told you about what my project is about i.e what is ARBook, so basically I have worked on marked identified image targets, on which we hover our camera our virtual objects pop ups. this lets you experience the virtual objects in the real world and can interact with them. 
 **yes I would like to draw an important fact that image target has to be of 5-star rating otherwise you might face difficulty in tracking it and try to keep rating between 4 to 5 star . And i have used vuforia SDK for its development, there are other many available SDK  but choosing vuforia was my preference**
I have taken my notebook on which I have pasted a printout of my image target and on the right page, I have written information about planets ao the moment we will point our camera to the image target our virtual 3D objects will appear.
I am providing my video link for a better understanding
